# 🖥️ **File Transfer System Using Python Sockets** 🚀

### **Sending Files Made Easy with Sockets!**

Welcome to my **File Transfer System** project, where I’ve used the power of **Python Sockets** to create a simple yet effective way to transfer files over a network. Whether you're a beginner exploring socket programming or just need a basic file transfer tool, this project has got you covered. 👨‍💻📂

## 🚀 **What is This?**

This project consists of two components:

- **Server**: The heart of the system. It waits patiently for clients, receives files, and saves them to the local system.
- **Client**: The initiator of the connection. It sends files to the server using TCP sockets.

## 🌐 **How It Works**

1. **Server** 🏠
   - Opens a port and listens for incoming client connections.
   - Accepts the file and saves it with the provided filename.

2. **Client** 🧑‍💻
   - Connects to the server.
   - Sends the filename and file data in manageable chunks.
   - Closes the connection once the file is successfully transferred.

## 💡 **Why You’ll Love It**

- **Simple**: One of the easiest ways to send files over a network.
- **Real-time**: The file is sent instantly from the client to the server.
- **Perfect for Beginners**: Great for learning how sockets work and the basics of networking.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

- **Python 3.x**: For the main programming.
- **Sockets**: TCP-based socket programming for communication between the client and server.

## 🚀 **How to Set It Up?**

### 🏗️ **Getting Started**

1. **Clone this repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/file-transfer-socket.git
   cd file-transfer-socket
   ```

2. **Create a test file** (or use your own):

   ```python
   with open("testfile.txt", "w") as file:
       file.write("This is a test file. Let's transfer it using sockets!")
   ```

3. **Run the Server:**
   - Open a terminal, go to the server's directory, and run:

   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

   - The server will be up and running on **127.0.0.1:12345** and will wait for the client to connect.

4. **Run the Client:**
   - In another terminal, go to the client’s directory and execute:

   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```

   - The client will connect to the server, send the file, and close the connection once done.

### 💾 **File Structure**

```

├── server.py         # Server-side script
├── testfile.txt      # Example file for testing
└── README.md         # Project documentation
```

## 🎨 **Why Sockets?**

Sockets allow us to establish direct communication between the client and server over a network. By using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), we ensure that our file is transferred reliably with error checking, making the process both efficient and secure.

## 🚀 **Example Outputs:**

### Server Side:

```
Server listening on 127.0.0.1:12345...
Connection established with ('127.0.0.1', 56789)
Receiving file: testfile.txt
Saving the received file...
File received and saved successfully.
```

### Client Side:

```
Sending file...
File sent successfully.
```
